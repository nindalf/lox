# Lox

The Lox language is a toy language described in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). I'm writing the compiler in this repository as I follow along. I'm using Rust as the implementation language.

A huge thanks to the authors of `nom` and `nom_locate` for showing me elegant ways of parsing text in Rust.
